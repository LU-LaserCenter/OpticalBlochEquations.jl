# OpticalBlochEquations.jl

Package to solve Optical Bloch Equations for alkali atoms in steady-state conditions. 
Computes density matrix, accounting for Doppler effect, at various magnetic field values under the action of a laser field of specified polarization.
Based on this density matrix computes fluorescence of specified polarization and probe beam absorption, also of specified polarization.
